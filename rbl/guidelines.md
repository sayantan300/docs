# Bots in the RBL Discord Server Must Not
- Spam channels

- Respond to non-prefixed commands
- Spontaneously send messages

If your bot breaks any of the rules of *RBL Discord Server*, we have the right to *block DMs* from that bot, *muting* the bot, and *kicking/banning* the bot when required.

Bot removal from the RBL Discord server would mean that your bot does **not appear** on the bot list.
