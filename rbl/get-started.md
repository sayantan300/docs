# Get Started
This guide will show you how to get started with RBL, and add a bot.

## Step 1
**Join the RBL Server**
Make sure you are in the [ROVEL STARS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Rf3xPMm) to enable you to add a bot.


## Step 2
**Add a Bot**
[Login]([https://bots.rovelstars.ga/login) to the RBL Dashboard to your server.
This will redirect you to a Discord oauth link which should auto login to RBL, with your currently logged-in Discord account.
After logging into the dashboard, you can [add a bot](https://bots.rovelstars.ga/dashboard/bots/new) by clicking on the '+' icon.


## Step 3
**Fill in the Form and Post**

Your bot has now been added to the approval queue!
Please be patient, and if you have correctly followed the [Bot Guidelines](/guidelines) your bot may be accepted.

## Step 4
**Make sure you don't block our official RBL bot**

This bot is the one and only bot which works alongside and for RBL, and if you want messages via dms as notifications, this bot does that. We promise to respect your DMs, just like your inbox of your mail. Therefore only important messages and stuff will be only send via DMs. ROVEL BOT, which is also a bot from us, dosen't works for RBL, but it works for all our websites, and our discord server, so keeping it unblocked also helps us to send notifications and important messages via DMs.



*NOTE:* If your bot follows all the rules mentioned [here](https://bots.rovelstars.ga/docs/best-practices) there will be 99% of chance of being approved on our bot list.
