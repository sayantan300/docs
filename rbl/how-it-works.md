# How It Works
All searched bots are ranked by the most votes.
If two bots have same number of votes, the bot which posts server stats, will be shown higher than the bot who didn't posted server stats.

## New Bots
Bots less than one week old, ranked by the most votes.

## Searching
`Overview`, `Body` and `Tags`, in order of use, are used to display results.

To best results make sure to optimize these fields with keywords etc.
